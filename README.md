# Fullstack-Weatherly
A fullstack weather app made with Reactjs, Expressjs and Typescript.

This App comes from my desire to learn fetching external data, setting up the backend for such data, and working with React in a Typescript environment.

## Tech stack
### Backend
- Express.js - API calls, routes, and setting up the server.
- React - All my components are functional components. I setup global state using React hooks and the context API.
- CSS Modules - I decided to go with CSS modules to set specific styles for each component.
- Typescript - This is the first time I implement Typescript on a project. The first programming language I learnt was C#, so Typescript felt pretty natural to me, and I'll definetely be using it more on future projects.
